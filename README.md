# Multiplayer Hangman game

" A real-time multiplayer Hangman game. Yeah it's going to blow your damn mind! " 

So they say. This project is getting a reboot this year, hopefully just in time for haktoberfest ! 

## Purpose 

A collab project between Redditors with the purpose to learn new technologies as we go. This project has issues of varying difficulties so all are welcome.
It was created to help devs advance in their skillset, have a bit of fun, and make something interesting.

## Getting Started

Based on the [MVC architecture](http://todomvc.com/examples/vanilla-es6/)

Come hang out with us at our Discord channel here:

Fork the repo.

Get task assigned.

Use your awesome coding skills to fix some of the bugs!

## Running the project
In console:
````
npm install
npm run dev //will run webpack-dev-server, letting you view your changes faster by instantly building when a file changes.
navigate browser to http://localhost:3000/
````

````
//to build project
npm run build 
````

## Contributing Requirements
* Readability is key. If you find it's getting too long, separate it out
* Flexibility: Make a "popWindow()" function, don't just manipulate all the values in an unrelated function
* You will need to be assigned a task before you can start working on any issues. Discord is generally a good way to go about this at the moment

## Seeking help

We're available on discord, or you can post a specific issue in the issues list here. We like questions!

## MANDATORY RULES

* If you get task assigned and you've been absent for a while on a critical part of the project, someone else will do it in your stead.

## Sidenotes

We've started off with an existing version of this project that didn't get too far on the Express Framework. This was overkill for our needs, so we more or less now have a simpler node application.
