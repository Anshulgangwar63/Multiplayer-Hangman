# Multiplayer Hangman game

A real-time multiplayer Hangman game. Yeah it's going to blow your damn mind!

It was created to help devs advance in their skillset and to learn to work together in a team.

## Running the project

````
npm install
npm run dev
navigate browser to http://localhost:3000/
````
The back end was created with express generator, in case you're familiar with it: app.js, bin/, routes/, views/ are part of the back end.


## Contributing Requirements
* Readability should be the name of the game here. No need to try to be super clever and making complicated one line statements. It's a group effort not a competition.
* You will need to be assigned a task before you can start working on any issues. Please make a comment that you would
like to work on a specific issue before starting.

## MANDATORY RULES

* PR's need to mention what bug/feature you are working on.
* If you get a task assigned but then go afk for a week or longer you wil be removed from the task in order to not hold
the project back.

## Sidenotes

Uses webpack-dev-server

Express will be installed and I included the files. We will tie it with a backend in further releases. Do not worry about it right now.
